<p align="center"><strong>Vendored and extended isocline engine for CJ's Shell</strong></p>

This directory contains the `cjsh_isocline` static library used by `cjsh` for interactive terminal input. It is based on isocline and has been significantly adapted for CJ's Shell features such as advanced keybinding hooks, status messaging, prompt-line behaviors, and shell-specific integration paths.

The target is built as ISO C11, compiles with `IC_SEPARATE_OBJS=1`, and exports headers (including a generated compatibility include path) for the shell runtime.

> **WARNING** this fork intentionally diverges from upstream isocline to support cjsh behavior. prefer tagged CJ's Shell releases for stability.

## Build this module through the root project

This module is expected to be built from the repository root so shared build flags, metadata, and threading configuration are applied.

```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build --parallel
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

Tests in `../test/` are built when `BUILD_TESTING=ON` (the default from `include(CTest)`). Configure with `-DBUILD_TESTING=OFF` to build only `cjsh_isocline`.

## Module layout

- `src/isocline.h` - public API surface consumed by `cjsh`
- `src/editline*.c` - interactive line editing and buffer control
- `src/completion*.c` / `src/highlight*` - completion and highlighting engine
- `src/history*` - history store and retrieval logic
- `src/isocline_*.c` - cjsh-specific integration points and behaviors
- `src/term*` / `src/tty*` - terminal, TTY, and escape-sequence handling

## Upstream and license

This module is distributed under the MIT License as part of CJ's Shell.
It includes work from the original isocline project by Daan Leijen, with extensive cjsh-focused modifications.
